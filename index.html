<!-- Month 1-3: Laying the foundations, and making the budget
 

Month 4-6:  It's always a good
idea to book your tickets beforehand since prices fluctuate on the regular and availability can also be an issue. The
same goes for hotels, last minute reservations can often lead you into settling for bad options. In short, the earlier
you book, the better deals you get. However, we will ask you not to book any tours or site-seeing as they can be much
more reasonable on-site.

Month 7-9: Enriching the experience
Things got real. Your plan is pretty much coming together now and you will need to double down on your initial research.
Watch travel vlogs on YouTube to see how others have done it. Join Facebook communities and engage in discussions, reach
out to locals if possible. Learn about cultural shocks and differences, and learn a few words that will come in handy.
Get to know the place better so that once you get there, you do not have to waste time on deciding. The fun begins as
soon as you reach.

Month 10-12: Home stretch!
We are now entering the final phase. This is where you need to do the final touch-ups. Get your visa and even if it gets
rejected, you will have plenty of time to apply again. Get some shopping done and buy the essentials you need for the
trip.
